      <h2>Becoming a Kaitiaki at Our School</h2>
      <p>Mount Roskill Grammar School encourages all students to become kaitiaki, undertake small actions that contribute against deforestation and supporting our local community.</p>
      <!-- Ordered list for the things you should do -->
      <ol>
        <li><b>Paper usage</b>: By using digital solutions instead of paper and printing less, you may reduce the amount of paper used and contribute to the preservation of forests. Using paperless communication and recycled paper both help to save the environment.</li>
        <li><b>Plant Based Diet</b>: By decreasing the need for livestock farming, which is a primary cause of habitat destruction and forest clearing, adopting a plant-based diet contributes to the reduction of deforestation. By encouraging more ethical and sustainable methods of food production, it also promotes biodiversity, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves water.
  </li>
        <li><b>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</b>: Reducing, reusing, and recycling lessen the need to clear forests for resource extraction, which in turn lessens the demand for new raw materials and helps prevent deforestation. We reduce the demand on forests to produce wood, paper, and other products by encouraging the use of recycled materials and minimizing waste, which helps to maintain these vital ecosystems.
  </li>
      </ol>
