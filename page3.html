<p>For more than a decade, statisticians have been recording the amount of hectares in forest area changing. Thanks to "Our World In Data" we can see the statistics and the effects of deforestation.</p>

  <button class="accordion">The net change in forest is defined as the sum of all changes in forest area over a specific period of time. Therefore it is measured as tree plantation minus deforestation.<span class="arrow">&#9660;</span></button>

  <button class="accordion">Between 2010-2020, the net total loss (deforestation plus gain in forest) in forests all across the world was 4.7 million hectares each year. It is confirmed that the rate of deforestation is much higher than the rate of trees grown. An estimation of 10 million hectares of trees are felled every year.<span class="arrow">&#9660;</span></button>
