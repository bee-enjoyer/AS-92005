      <p>At Mount Roskill Grammar School, we value community and environmental care, aligning with Māori principle Kaitiakitanga, emphasizing guardianship and protection. We want to ensure that the community of Mt Roskill is sustainable, eco-friendly, and culturally amusing with the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
      <h2>What is Kaitiakitanga?</h2>
      <p>Kaitiakitanga is a Māori way of life that teaches respect for the environment, entrusted to safeguard spaces for future generations.</p>

          <h2>Effects of Deforestation</h2>
          <p>Vandalism not only damages our health and well-being, but also impacts the environment and our local community in numerous ways:</p>
          <!-- List with bullet points on the effects of deforestation -->
          <ul class="list1">
            <li><b>Climate Change:</b> Forests regulate Earth's temperature by removing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide released back into the atmosphere after fires or harvests worsens climate change and global warming.</li>
            <li><b>Conditions in the ecosystem:</b> Deforestation threatens global communities' access to essential resources like lumber, fruits, and nuts, and disrupts their customs, as forests provide food, shelter, and revenue.</li>
            <li><b>Impacts on human personal health:</b> Felling multiple trees decreases oxygen production, leading to higher Carbon Dioxide concentrations, causing harmful air quality that we breathe. This causes stress and depression, affecting both physical and mental health.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="list2">
          <li>"One thing leads to the other. Deforestation leads to climate change, which leads to ecosystem losses, which negatively impacts our livelihoods. It's a vicious cycle." - Gisele Bundchen</li>
          <li>"The rainforest is a fragile ecosystem, and unless we do something to protect it, we could lose it completely within our lifetime." - Sting</li>
          <li>"Deforestation is changing our climate, harming people and the natural world. We must, and can reverse this trend." - Jane Goodall</li>
          <li>"The forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people." - Franklin D. Roosevelt</li>
